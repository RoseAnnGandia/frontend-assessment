Note on Exercise 1 : Assets were downloaded on the internet due to access issues on Github.

For Exercise 3 my answer is :

the result of strings 'b' + 'a' = ba
the result of +'a' = NaN means "Not a Number" , +'a' trying to convert a number using unary plus operator
then add the 'a'

'b' + 'a' + NaN + 'a' = baNaNa and convert to lowercase

the final result will be banana
